    "content": "A house next to a forest. A neighbourhood surrounded of a vast amount of trees. Over the last couple weeks the snow has melted, giving way to Spring. I've been impatient for this time. Everything has come to life again ready to begin new. In my forest walks I tune into my senses and practice simply being. When you are out in nature you are forced to encounter yourself . I spent a lot of time observing, wondrous, praying, waiting.. And I've come to the conclusion that to live a simple fulfilling existence, you must embrace your own unique path. Power to cultivate happiness and joy. The answer to a simple life is up to you. We have the power to cultivate happiness and joy. And this, is the reason why I chose to name this post 'Beauty in Simplicity'. In styles like Modern or Minimalist the concept involves getting things down to their most basic form. It can be seen from art and lifestyle to architecture and design. This style use bare essentials create clean and uncluttered spaces, finding the Beauty in Simplicity. More interested about Modernism read <here> or You can read more about Minimalism <here>. Another way designing a space with this Modern or Minimalis style is using a monochromatic pallete with colour used as an accent, mixing open spaces, a, lot of light and functional furniture. Nevertheless when you liven a tight budget or in a 800 square-foot apartment the Beauty in Simplicity certainly speak out just about adding a small fraction of ingredients that goes into the atmosphere and heart of a home."
